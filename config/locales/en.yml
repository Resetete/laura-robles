# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

          part_2: 'When I was 4 years old I started playing cajon, my first teacher was Amador Chebo Ballumbrosio, I was with him until I was 12 years old, then he never wanted to give me lessons again, he told me that I asked too many questions. My neighbor Susana Baca, Peruvian singer, opened an institute called Negro Continuo and I could follow theory classes there with Nilo Borges, Cuban violinist and an incredible person who gave me hours of teaching for years and in parallel I could listen to rehearsals, meet many musicians who passed through there and play with my first bands. Then I met Laureano Rigol and Roberto Borrell, both Cubans, with whom I learned technique and theory, traditional and popular Cuban music, among other things. I started playing electric bass at the age of 20, I formed different projects, but so far the most important project is the Astrocombo.'
          part_3: 'I have worked with musicians from many countries and participated in international festivals. Currently, I spend most of my time researching different ways of writing traditional rhythms, how to explain what groove is and composing. I also have an experimental music trio called Tripas, I am part of the band Perfektomat led by Joscha Oetz, I work together with Peter Ehwald, our project is called Camina, a duo with Carlos Corona and I work on my solo project Antigroove.'
